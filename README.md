# Clone-of-Excel
For my project, I developed a clone of Excel using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allowed me to apply a variety of web development skills to mimic the functionality of a spreadsheet application.

The foundation of the project was built using HTML to structure the layout, where I created tables to simulate the rows and columns seen in an Excel sheet. I ensured that each cell could hold data and be uniquely identified, providing the essential framework for further interaction.

CSS was instrumental in styling the interface, giving the application a clean, grid-like structure and a user-friendly design. I used CSS to define the cell size, table borders, and overall layout, focusing on creating an appearance that closely resembled Excel. Responsive design techniques were also implemented to ensure the interface worked well across different screen sizes.

JavaScript played a central role in adding interactivity and logic to the clone. I leveraged JavaScript to manage user inputs, allowing dynamic content to be entered into cells. Additionally, I used event listeners to capture actions like clicking or typing in cells, mimicking Excelâ€™s behavior. Through DOM manipulation, I created features like selecting multiple cells, copying, pasting, and implementing basic formulas such as addition and subtraction within the cells. I also implemented real-time updates, so changes in one cell would instantly reflect in others.

This project helped me reinforce my knowledge of front-end web development and provided insight into how complex applications like Excel can be designed from scratch using fundamental web technologies. It improved my problem-solving skills, especially in managing data relationships and user interactions, offering a deeper understanding of how to create functional and interactive web applications.
